# Introduction to Flask
## Introduction to Web Apps with Flask
### Learn about the Flask microframework for creating web applications in Python!
Welcome to the section of the course focused on getting started with Flask. In this section, you will learn about the microframework Flask and have the opportunity to build your own simple web application!

After creating your own application, dive into the world of templates, which allow you to add complexity to the pages of your application by injecting Python into your HTML.

Lastly, you will explore adding more functionality to your app with forms, which allow you to ask users of your site for information.

Let’s get started!

## What is the Back-end?

In order to deliver the front-end of a website or web application to a user, a lot needs to happen behind the scenes on the back-end! Understanding what makes up the back-end can be overwhelming because the back-end has a lot of different parts, and different websites or web applications can have dramatically different back-ends. We covered a lot in this lesson, so let’s review what we learned:

* The front-end of a website or application consists of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and static assets sent to a client, like a web browser.
* A web server is a process running on a computer somewhere that listens for incoming requests for information over the internet and sends back responses.
* Storing, accessing, and manipulating data is a large part of a web application’s back-end
* Data is stored in databases which can be relational databases or NoSQL databases.
* The server-side of a web application, sometimes called the application server, handles important tasks such as authorization and authentication.
* The back-end of web application often has a web API which is a way of interacting with an application’s data through HTTP requests and responses.
* Together the technologies used to build the front-end and back-end of a web application are known as the stack, and many different languages and frameworks can be used to build a robust back-end.

Now that you have a sense for server-side web development and what the back-end is, you’re ready to dive in and learn about the different parts in more depth!
